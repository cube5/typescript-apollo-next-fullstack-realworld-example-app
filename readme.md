# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [YOUR_FRAMEWORK] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[YOUR_FRAMEWORK]** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# How it works

This is a next application with a custom express server that serves the next application and exposes an Apollo graphql endpoint. Typescript is all over the place of course.

# Getting started

Starts the `next` app (`http://localhost:3000/`) and serves a `GraphQL` endpoint (`http://localhost:3000/graphql`).

```bash
npm run dev
```
